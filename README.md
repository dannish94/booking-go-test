Technical Test for BookingGo - Dannish Hussain.


To view, clone the repo and run 'yarn' on directory to do an installation. Once installed run 'yarn start' to run the server and view it in development mode @ http://localhost:3000


Likewise to run the test suite, run 'yarn test'


Tech used: 

 --- ReactJS using Styled-Components for styling, Jest/Enzyme for testing. ---
 

Notes for improvement:

 --- Could of been developed in TDD & accurately tested over time with snapshot testing too see changes in the interface ---
 
 --- Improvement on media queries, otherwise built with mobile first approach --- 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
