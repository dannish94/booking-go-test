Likewise to run the test suite, run 'yarn test'

<b>Tech used: </b>

 ReactJS using Styled-Components for styling, Jest/Enzyme for testing.
 

<b>Notes for improvement: </b>

 Could of been developed in TDD & accurately tested over time with snapshot testing too see changes in the interface
 
 Improvement on media queries, otherwise built with mobile first approach
